The genre itself is the star. I don't like to say this about <a href=#>David Arquette</a>, who is a jolly nice guy, but I doubt many people went to "<a href=#>Scre4m</a>" to see him; they wanted to see the slasher in the mask.</p><p>That said, there are substantial qualities in "Stake Land," a movie that probably uses zombies as little as it can get away with. Considering that the dialogue calls them "vamps" for short, they're apparently some kind of zombie/vampire hybrid, previously unidentified by Horror Science. The Dead have merged with the Undead. You see what spraying with insecticides can lead to.</p><p>The movie mercifully focuses on a handful of characters as they journey toward a perhaps mythical New Eden. We begin with the voice of a young narrator, Martin (<a href=#>Connor Paolo</a>), who explains how after his family was massacred, he came under the protection of Mister (<a href=#>Nick Damici</a>). How they are driving in a big boat of a classic car through a wasteland of threat and paranoia. How Mister instructs him in the skills of survival. There are echoes here, less eloquent, of "<a href=#>The Road</a>."</p><p>Mister has hard-earned expertise about vamps. A bullet will slow them down but all that will kill them is the proverbial stake, driven into the base of the skull, where allegedly resides the Reptile Brain. He schools Martin in eternal vigilance, and they survive surprise attacks by zombies who sometimes seem suspiciously well-coordinated with one another (given their presumed inability to communicate).</p><p>Mister is like a Western hero committed to doing the right thing. When he sees Sister Anna (<a href=#>Kelly McGillis</a>), a nun, being attacked by zombies, he rescues her. Their little band grows to include Belle (<a href=#>Danielle Harris</a>), a pregnant young girl, and Willie (<a href=#>Sean Nelson</a>), who was a Marine.</p><p>On the road they encounter rare safety zones, carefully guarded communities barricaded against strangers. Some of these are run, however, by religious cultists looking forward to the end of days. The scariest is a venomous loony named Jebedia (<a href=#>Michael Cerveris</a>). This is not so unlikely. I just saw a report on CNN about Branch Davidian members looking for the resurrection of David Koresh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq5qjlWK5orrDZmlpaWE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
