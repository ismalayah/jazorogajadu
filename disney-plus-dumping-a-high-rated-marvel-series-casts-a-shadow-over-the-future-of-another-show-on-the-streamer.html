It is clear which one is a fan and critic favorite of the two and yet, both Disney Plus and Hulu thought it would be a good idea to disappoint their subscribers as much as humanly possible. So, the real question is what is stopping the former from doing it again?</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>With that knowledge in the back of their minds, subscribers are now worrying if the disappearance of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel‚Äôs Cloak & Dagger</a></strong> is also coming.
