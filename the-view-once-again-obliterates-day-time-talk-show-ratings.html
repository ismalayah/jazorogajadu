This year, we also took the audience with us on our search for a new conservative co-host, welcomed back former co-hosts for our milestone anniversary and celebrated with a fun-filled week in The Bahamas. Now, with midterms approaching, we’re ready to gear up for more political interviews and debates and to welcome our two new Republican co-hosts.”</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>The View will return for its 26th season in September and attempt to go three for three at the 2022 – 2023 charts this time next year.
