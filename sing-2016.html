But, luckily, its makers know all too well how to fully exploit the power of a catchy pop song. There are more than 65 dynamite ditties—from the Beatles and Irving Berlin to Beyonce and Carly Rae Jepsen—exploited to their full crowd-pleasing potential as the choices smartly span the decades.&nbsp;</span></p><p>On the surface, this story of koala bear impresario Buster Moon (<a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a>, nicely capturing this pint-size showman who is part huckster, part dreamer and part the actor’s exuberant strip-club emcee from “<a href=#>Magic Mike</a>”) who decides to give his run-down theater a boost by staging a talent contest is simply plugging into the ongoing popularity of reality shows such as “American Idol” and “The Voice.”</p><p>But director/writer <a href=#>Garth Jennings</a> (live-action cult faves “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy," “<a href=#>Son of Rambow</a>”)—expanding upon a concept conceived by Illumination CEO and founder Chris Meledandri (whose animation house was also behind the summer success “<a href=#>The Secret Life of Pets</a>,” and the Minions phenom)—relies on an even older tradition. Namely, those “Hey, let’s put on a show” movies from the ‘30s and ‘40s that paired a youthful <a href=#>Judy Garland</a> and <a href=#>Mickey Rooney</a> as they saved the day with song and dance. There is a reason it’s a tried and true underdog formula, and it mostly works here.&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out there are plenty of amateur hopefuls looking for a break in “<span>Sing,” whose balmy palm-tree-lined urban setting is never named, especially after Moon’s elderly assistant Miss Crawly (a crone-like stooped green lizard with a glass eyeball whose comical croak is provided by Jennings) mistakenly ups the prize ante on a flier announcing the competition from $1,000 to $100,000.</span></p><p>The ark’s worth of would-be contestants that storm the theater to audition range from a trio of bunnies who twerk their fuzzy behinds to the naughty “<a href=#>Anaconda</a>” to a Teutonic pig nailing “Bad Romance” in a tight gold-glitter jumpsuit. Buster quickly whittles down the choices to five finalists and, just as they do on every TV&nbsp;<span>singing&nbsp;contest, they all have an emotional back story to share.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46soKefXWd9coI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
