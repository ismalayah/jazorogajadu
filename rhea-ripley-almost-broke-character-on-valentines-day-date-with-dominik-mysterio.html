The two have an interesting relationship, to say the least. A lot of their attraction might have been ignited by a shared interest in tormenting Rey Mysterio.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=#>Wrestling with Rosenberg</a>, Rhea Ripley remembered her experience going out on that date with Dominik Mysterio. Obviously, they had a blast on that WWE shoot.</p><p>“Yeah, that thing was quite hilarious. That was a lot of fun to cause that sort of mayhem with the Mysterio family. At the end of the day, like Rey stole our table. We were [in the right]. Yes, Dom put it down under the Mysterio name but at the end of the day Rey called and was like, ‘yeah, we’re on our way’ and he took our table,” she said.</p><p>The SmackDown Women’s Champion added that Dominik Mysterio really put things over the edge when he ordered chicken fingers. That just fits Prison Dom’s character, because he’s a simple man.</p><p>“So, of course we’re gonna kick him out. Like, that’s just what happened, like, ‘move, it’s Valentine’s Day. This is our first Valentine’s Day date and we wanna eat here. This is why we booked it here.’ But he did give me a little bit of a chuckle when he wanted chicken fingers at a nice restaurant. [He’s a simple man. No one said he’s a complicated man.] He’s definitely not. It’s great.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rhea Ripley and Dominik Mysterio are not slowing down on WWE television. If anything, they have even more going for them now that Ripley is a Women’s Champion. Only time will tell if they take their relationship to the next level, but they’re really having fun right now.</p><p>Dominik Mysterio is a heat magnet, and Triple H doesn’t want to ruin a good thing when he has it. Odds are we will see a lot more from Judgment Day in the months to come.</p><p>What’s your take on Dominik Mysterio and Rhea Ripley’s relationship?
