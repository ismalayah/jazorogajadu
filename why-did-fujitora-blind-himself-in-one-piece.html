Recommended Videos Some time during the two-year time skip, Fujitora rose to the rank of Admiral before finally meeting the Straw Hats during the Dressrosa arc. Initially, Luffy believed he was an ordinary (albeit very strong) old man, but it was soon revealed Fujitora was an Admiral who possessed a powerful Devil Fruit power."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He generally calls upon this power with his sword and is capable of pulling large objects – such as meteorites – toward him at a high speed from as far away as space. His control over gravity allows him to press opponents deep into the earth, and can prevent them from escaping.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Even without his incredible Devil Fruit power, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujitora is a strong swordsman</a> and accomplished Haki user as befitting his rank of Admiral. Given his incredible battle prowess, it’s hard to believe he could be blinded; let alone blind himself.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Hard as it is to believe, Fujitora chose to blind himself as part of his own personal brand of justice, as he believed some evils were not meant to be seen. Although he typically views his blindness as a good thing, Fujitora says he wishes he hadn’t blinded himself, as he wished to see Luffy toward the end of the events of the Dressrosa Arc.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Like all Marine Admirals, Fujitora has his own personal justice to which he adheres. Fujitora follows Moral Justice, and enacts this justice primarily through protecting innocents and actively hunting down criminals. This desire to eradicate evil extends toward the Marines and the World Government itself, and Fujitora wishes to weed out corruption from these entities all together.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=860 data-injectable=true>That being said, he isn’t naive. Fujitora has aligned himself with those he views unsavory in order to accomplish his goals (though he does let them know he fully intends to capture them later). After all the evil he has seen in the world, he believes blinding himself to be a blessing. His strong sense of justice helps balance out his fellow Admirals and helps him shake things up on occasion; Fujitora led the charge to abolish the Seven Warlords of the Sea as a practice.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Not much is known about him, but it’s likely he will continue to be a major player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as One Piece continues</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllJ6xbrLUo6Ctp6KWeqO4yKebZqCZosCmuMVmoKdln6OybrzInpqeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
