She has released four new albums in the meantime, Lovers, Folklore, Evermore, and the recently released Midnight. She also re-recorded both Fearless and Red under the subtitle of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor’s Version</a> so she can own her older music.&nbsp;So if you are a Taylor Swift fan and are excited about her upcoming The Eras Tour, click <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> to preregister for tickets so you do not miss out when the tickets eventually go on sale in a couple of weeks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46tmLKkn6d6tMPIn6usZZWnrrR506isq2WknrCssdNmp6uhk5rAbsDOrqlmnJGpsrR5wKebZqCfrHq1u4ybrLJlpJ6wrLHTrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
