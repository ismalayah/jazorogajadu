Recommended Videos In a recent interview for Nerdist, Fuller once again expressed his desire to continue with the show after NBC’s cancellation back in 2015. Three seasons were in no way what the showrunner had in mind for Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham’s story, and having to wrap it up early has clearly left the cast and crew disappointed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Three seasons were in no way what the showrunner had in mind for Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham’s story, and having to wrap it up early has clearly left the cast and crew disappointed. Nevertheless, Fuller knows exactly where he wants to take the show should Hannibal be picked up for another season, and readily gave fans a glimpse of what that would entail when the topic arose:</p><p>“There’s something about, you know, where we left Will and Hannibal at the cliff and this power, tenderness, and intimacy that they are experiencing in that moment that feels like it’s a launch pad. I don’t think we can pull back but we have to continue the trajectory and continue that level of intimate exploration between these two men and their queer love story, their queer blurring of identities. And how that would manifest in a narrative that we can track.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hannibal-1.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Of course, Fuller has said before that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Will and Hannibal’s relationship</a> wasn’t always intended to develop the way it did, but as the show progressed, the showrunner rolled with it, giving greater depth to these two characters’ connection. Making sure they stay true to their essence is just as important, though, and Fuller considers there is a way to do that while exploring the more intimate aspects of their dynamic:</p><p>“If you didn’t like season three you probably won’t like season four but if you like the trajectory you’re going to love where it’s going spending time with it. Thinking about it, it does become more intimate and I do see pathways of expressing that intimacy in ways that I think that the Fannibal family will feel validated by and also doesn’t feel like it’s a cheat with the characters.”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>These claims are everything any Hannigram shipper has ever wanted to hear, and fans’ hope for a fourth season is renewed. Just last year, a petition for a new season made the rounds online, with Bryan Fuller himself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showing support for it</a> by urging fans to sign.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, not everyone is so positive. Hugh Dancy, who plays Will, doesn’t seem to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holding out hope</a> for new episodes, despite how much the cast and crew would love for it to happen. For Fannibals, though, hope is the last thing to die, and it’s clear they’re going nowhere for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yprc2noJuZnGLAqbvWq6ynppWneqKwzKKpmpqcrnq0wMilo2aslZbAqrrGZqelmZ6oeqe70WaYZp6fqr%2B1tIysnJqrn6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
