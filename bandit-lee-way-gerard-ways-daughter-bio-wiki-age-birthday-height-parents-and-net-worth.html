Bandit’s excited parents documented every stage of their pregnancy and finally welcomed Bandit in May 2009.</p><p>She was nicknamed Baby Way and Lady B by her fans. Despite achieving the status of a minor celebrity, Bandit’s parents decided to keep her away from the public and social media. There are very few public photographs of Bandit from her early years. Many fans also took to clicking photographs of Bandit stealthily in order to have a glimpse of her.</p><p>With time, Bandit’s parents became comfortable discussing parenthood and Bandit’s presence to the public and their fans. They also made public appearances with Bandit, and the media snapped a cute toddler who stole the hearts of the crowd. Her charming looks coupled with her innocence made her a huge hit among the punk-rock crowd.</p><p>Her parents decided to create a faux Twitter account for her to document her experiences as well. Gerard was often touted to be the ‘Dad of the Year’ after fans realized how much he adored his daughter. Bandit’s popularity has only soared over the years as fans are eagerly awaiting to see if she’ll jump into the music scene along with her parents. She was recently seen at the Rupaul’s Drag Con convention for 2018 in New York City.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bandit-lee-way-gerard-way></span><span>Bandit Lee Way Gerard Way</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Way joined American rock band My Chemical Romance in 2001 as their bassist and suggested the band’s name after he read the book Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance.
