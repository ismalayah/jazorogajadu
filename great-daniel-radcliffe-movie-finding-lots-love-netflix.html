We’re talking about Jon M. Chu’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Now You See Me 2</a>, which has been proving hugely popular with Netflix subscribers this week, as it’s jumped over 20 places to currently rank as the ninth most-watched title with viewers around the world.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/161064702643473864-2021-03-05T131713.600.jpeg alt="Now You See Me 2" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Louis Leterrier’s first installment boasted a solid premise and an even stronger ensemble cast, but after a hugely promising start, the third act was a total mess, with the final twist in particular almost sinking the entire thing. However, a box office haul of over $350 million saw a sequel get the green light, and while Now You See Me 2 didn’t perform terribly well with critics, audiences seemed to enjoy it.</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=false>Sure, the plot is more convoluted than before, but there’s admittedly still plenty of undemanding entertainment to be had and Radcliffe is great in his role. The sequel performed almost identically to its predecessor by hauling in just under $335 million globally, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">both a potential third film</a> and a spinoff for Jay Chou’s character have remained stuck in development hell. Still, the failure of more adventures to materialize clearly hasn’t deterred Netflix subscribers from checking out this great&nbsp;<strong>Daniel Radcliffe&nbsp;</strong>movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonqudkal6pa3NopylZaKWsaS4yJ%2BdnmWdpMOqsYyfoKecmaO0brjOrapmpJ%2Brsm66xK2dpaGoZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
