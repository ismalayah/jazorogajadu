It cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action movie star, confirmed James Cameron as a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood, and proved that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a> could indeed do no wrong.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>Ditching her horror roots for high-octane action and humor, Jamie Lee Curtis stars as Helen Tasker, the wife of computer salesman Harry Tasker. Helen leads a relatively boring, ordinary life, and is under the impression her husband does too. Except, in reality, Harry is not a computer salesman — he’s a government spy. His “work trips” that frequently take him away from his family are actually life-or-death government operations.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Helen’s desire to live a more exciting and fuller life ends up landing her in trouble. Harry quickly steps in to remedy the situation while attempting to keep his double life a secret, but in the end, the pair wind up on an unforeseen roller coaster ride that is full of its own life-or-death situations.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-was-jamie-lee-curtis-when-she-starred-in-true-lies data-injectable=false>How old was Jamie Lee Curtis when she starred in True Lies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/true-lies.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>By the time she starred as Helen Tasker in True Lies, Jamie Lee Curtis had already played Laurie Strode in both Halloween and Halloween II. She’d also already played the no-nonsense cop, Megan Turner in Blue Steel (1989) and starred opposite Mel Gibson in Forever Young (1992) as Claire Cooper.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>When it came time for her to play Helen in True Lies, Curtis was 36 years old. In fact, she celebrated her birthday by dangling off of a helicopter over the ocean, a stunt she refused to let her body double do in her place.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>The iconic striptease scene that True Lies – and Curtis – is often remembered for actually contained a bit of authenticity some fans might not know of. Not only were the matching bra and panties that Curtis wore her own, but the “accidental” fall she endured mid-striptease – the one that caused Schwarzenegger’s character to sit up in alarm – was actually choreographed by her and James Cameron without Schwarzenegger’s knowledge, according to the film’s trivia on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The scene in question drew criticism for being perceived as misogynistic but it was later confirmed that it had Curtis’ stamp of approval. She heavily collaborated with Cameron on the scene to get it right, and it was per her recommendation that Helen donned the bra and panties and danced in the light. Previously, her character was supposed to dance nude but entirely in the dark.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=false>Schwarzenegger made sure to clarify to his wife Maria Shriver, that he did not enjoy a single second of it, saying, “Honey, I hated every hour of it!” For her part, Curtis called the filming of True Lies, “Without question, the greatest experience of my professional life so far.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmopGitqZ5y56cZpulp8Gqv4yipWasoqqybrjInqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
