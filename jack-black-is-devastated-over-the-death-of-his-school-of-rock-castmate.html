"Devastating news. Kevin is gone. Way too soon," Black wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> with photos of the two on-set and reconnecting later in life. "Beautiful soul. So many great memories. Heartbroken. Sending love to his family and the whole 'School of Rock' community," he added hours after the news on May 26.</p><p data-children-count=0>It appears the two shared quite the bond off-camera, and in fact, Black was one of Clark's greatest role models. "For my eighth-grade social studies class, I had to interview somebody I admired," Clark recalled of his favorite memory with the actor for the cast's 10-year reunion in 2013 in an interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>. "So I asked Jack, 'Hey, can we do an interview?' and he was like, 'Yeah, come by my trailer.' So I go in there and he's playing Xbox BMX XXX and I sat there and he gave me a classic interview," Clark shared, adding, "He's my hero." Thanks to the "School of Rock," Clark's memory will live on forever at Horace Green prep and in the hearts of young rock lovers everywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpiZoZ2e8mamqRlkqGupLeMoqpmnJWrrrTAwK2cnWWfq7KzedOhnGaclZbBqXnOn2ShoaNiwKS0zqijZqeWYr%2Bwr8pmmpqrpKKutbGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
