Space and time are deliberately fractured. This has the effect of keeping the viewer hooked, always looking for that <i>next</i> feel-good visual fillip. In contrast, watch (and listen to) what Scorsese does in "Shine a Light." He'll pick a moment -- the strum of a guitar or a glance from one of the players -- as punctuation, to get from one shot to the next. (Also, the sound is mixed like a movie: Whoever's on the screen is usually brought forward in the mix for the duration of the shot.)</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/scanners/scorsese-and-music-as-storytelling-shine-a-light/shinekeef1-thumb-510x287-38535.jpg width=510 height=287 alt=shinekeef1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Each song becomes a coherent, choreographed piece of storytelling: <i>And then, Mick goes out on the runway and does a dance. Keith hits one guitar chord and passes the spotlight to Ronnie for the solo. Mick moves back to make faces at Charlie, then crosses behind Ronnie to do a little call-and-response with the background vocalists...</i> Stuff like that.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/scanners/scorsese-and-music-as-storytelling-shine-a-light/shinemick3-thumb-510x286-38538.jpg width=510 height=286 alt=shinemick3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>I don't know how much blocking was done in advance (the facetious prologue makes it seem as though the whole set list was sprung on Scorsese at the last minute, although there were reportedly two <a href=#>Beacon Theatre</a> shows and almost all the concert footage is from the second night), but what looks so effortless cannot have been easy to achieve, especially during a live show.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/scanners/scorsese-and-music-as-storytelling-shine-a-light/shinekeefxtc-thumb-510x285-38541.jpg width=510 height=285 alt=shinekeefxtc.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>"Shine a Light" is a movie some of today's choppy "action directors" could learn a thing or three from. By alternating shots that take in much of the stage with tighter groupings of musicians, Scorsese keeps the audience aware of where the players are in relationship to one another -- which, as I say, maintains the spacial integrity and momentum of the performance and sculpts the performers' movements into a cinematic dance fuses concert and film. Pay particular attention to "Tumbling Dice," one of my favorite songs and a choreographic highlight of this set. (In one shot -- during 'Brown Sugar,' I think -- <a href=#>Keith Richards</a> seems to step into another temporal dimension of pure musical ecstasy; I had to watch the shot a second time and confirm that, behind him, Charlie Watts was drumming in time with the music, to be sure it wasn't a slow-motion optical effect.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrJuRo7umvtJoqpynoqiytLGMmqWdZZ2qwKqvjJqqZqukpL%2B6wMSlo6Kml2LAqbXNnmSaZZyetKnA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
