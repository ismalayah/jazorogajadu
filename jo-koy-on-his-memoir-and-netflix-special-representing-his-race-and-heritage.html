And to give back to his culture, he has exploited his fame to represent his race and heritage.</span></p><p><span>And his efforts haven’t been restricted to stand-up comedy and comedy specials. In his memoir, Mixed Plate: Chronicles of an All-American Combo, he includes recipes for certain Filipino meals, such as lumpia and chicken adobo. </span><span>Here’s a peek at Koy’s pride in his background and his efforts to reflect it.</span></p><h2>Jo Koy Discusses Representing His Ethnicity</h2><p><span>Koy, whose actual name is Joseph Glenn Herbert, was born in the United States to an American father and a Filipino mother. When he was younger, he had a minimal understanding of other Filipinos on the comedy circuits.</span></p><p><span>But, like many entertainers of minority backgrounds, he encountered many problems in his early days in the business.</span></p><p><span>“When you come to Hollywood, they have no idea what they’re looking at—as bad as it sounds,”</span></p><p><span>He explained.</span></p><p><span>“What’s your backstory?” We don’t understand. “What are we going to do with you?”</span></p><p><span>Koy juggled up to three part-time jobs at the time and took whatever engagements he could find, including ethnic theme nights like “Wonton Wednesdays” and “Asian Invasion.”</span></p><p><span>He didn’t stand out as a comic for a long time. It wasn’t until he began sharing stories about his mother while copying her gestures and accent that he began to be identified.</span></p><p><span>In a few years, Koy rose to become one of the world’s most well-known comedians, with his own Netflix comedy series and memoir. </span><span>He earlier stated that he intended to publish the biography to tell others about his journey to achievement despite the hurdles that his mixed-race heritage presented.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not trying to give myself a pat on the back. When asked about his book, he stated, “It was a long path.”</span></p><p><span>“When I eventually arrived at this point in my career, all I did was glance at my manager.”</span></p><p><span>“I was like, ‘Man, I really want to tell others about this fight and how difficult it was to get here.'”</span></p><p><span>Aside from writing about his challenges, Koy spends a lot of time discussing his ethnicity and ancestry in his book. </span><span>In addition, Koy filmed his special, In His Element, in the Philippines. When speaking with Good Morning America about it, the comic revealed that he shot it in the Philippines to promote his culture while motivating his son.</span></p><p><span>“I get to talk about how proud I am to be Filipino, but I never get to show the world what the Philippines looks like,”</span></p><p><span>He explained.</span></p><p><span>“When I was a kid, I didn’t have any TV motivation like that.” And I wanted that to be the source of my motivation.”</span></p><p><span>In celebration of his work and Filipino American History Month, San Diego has designated Friday, October 16, 2020, as “Jo Koy Day.”</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jo Koy</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jo Koy Memoir</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqGWbpMZuu81mn6KrXaKyrrvIq2SappRiu6bAxaWgsWWjpbKktcClZKudoKeytLHNraCnn12dtrR50ZqanmWRo7FutMSroK2Zl5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
