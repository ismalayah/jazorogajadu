At only 25, Chloe has earned the kind of net worth it takes some people a lifetime to achieve.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-chloe-bailey-s-net-worth-so-high data-injectable=false>Why is Chloe Bailey’s net worth so high?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=630 data-current-count=930 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Chloe has a net worth of $2 million as of 2023. While it’s impossible to verify that exact number without access to sensitive financial info, it’s not surprising Chloe’s a high-earner when you look at how long she’s been on the scene. Chloe and her sister began writing songs at a very young age and their father became their co-manager, encouraging them to learn how to make their own music so they wouldn’t have to rely on outside help. This skill would take the girls far; Chloe is not only a talented artist, but an accomplished songwriter and producer as well.</p><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>The girls had small roles in 2003’s The Fighting Temptations alongside Beyoncé, who would later sign the duo to her Parkwood label a little over a decade later. After a stint on the Disney Channel circuit, the two girls started their own YouTube channel when Chloe was 13 and Halle was 11. The girls made a name for themselves performing masterfully-arranged covers of songs like their eventual mentor’s hits “Best I Never Had” and “Pretty Hurts.” Their YouTube success led them to perform on talk shows, Austin & Ally, and to a record deal in 2015.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chlöe (@chloebailey)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=835 data-injectable=true>As Chloe x Halle, they’ve put out critically-acclaimed albums including their latest, 2020’s Ungodly Hour (which this author thinks you should listen to if you like good music). While they built their music career, the girls simultaneously worked on building an acting career together on the aforementioned Grown-ish before pursuing individual roles. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halle famously was cast to play Ariel in the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid</a>, while Chloe starred in projects like the thriller Jane and the musical Praise This.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Most recently, Chloe released her first solo album, In Pieces, as Chlöe and went on an accompanying tour. She’s been taking a deserved break from releasing music, opting to promote collabs with CÎROC vodka and SOREL footwear in the meantime. With multiple brand deals and several upcoming films in the works, Chloe will continue to make the big bucks for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZOdubCxjJuYoqSVrsBuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
