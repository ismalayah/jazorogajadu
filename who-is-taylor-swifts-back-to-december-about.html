Unfortunately, this has led to some fans attacking Swift’s exes on social media. Consequently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swift has urged fans to be kind </a>once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)</a> is released. However, there is one song that’s different compared to the rest of the songs on the album, and it sounds more forgiving rather than spiteful.</p><h3 id=h-who-is-taylor-swift-s-back-to-december-about data-injectable=false>Who is Taylor Swift’s ‘Back to December’ about?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>“Back To December” was released back in 2010 and was the third track on Taylor Swift’s Speak Now album. Based on the song’s lyrics, it feels somewhat apologetic as Swift sings about her post-breakup regrets. At the same time, she also reminisces about the good times and how her life has changed.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, the identity of the person the song is based on was revealed. During a 2016 Scream Queens Facebook live stream, it was revealed that “Back To December” is about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight</a> star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Lautner</a>. The actor confirmed this fact to former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glee</a> actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lea Michele</a>, who originally thought that his song was featured in the Red album, then misheard the title as “Hat to December.”</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Lautner was asked about his thoughts on the album’s re-release,saying he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“feels safe but is praying for John.”</a> The actor also shared TikTok video expressing the same sentiment.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Lautner is on good terms with Swift. Not only did he star in the “I Can See You” music video, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he also appeared during the Kansas City leg of The Eras Tour</a>, where he gave a speech respecting Swift not just as a singer-songwriter but also as a human. Swift saw him as a “positive force” during the production of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@boneybumblebee href=#>@boneybumblebee</a><p>TAYLOR LAUTNER?!!!???? <a title=erastourtaylorswift href=#>#erastourtaylorswift</a> <a title=taylorlautner href=#>#taylorlautner</a> <a title=twilight href=#>#twilight</a> <a title=kansascity href=#>#kansascity</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - tess" href=#>♬ original sound – tess</a></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=false>Out of all the exes referenced in each of Swift’s songs, Lautner is seen as “the best ex” and “the fun uncle” by Swifties. He is not embarrassed to proclaim that the singer wrote a song about him, even having married a Swiftie and being involved in his ex’s music video. They have both matured since the breakup and can finally be seen as great friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn6hlmah6ta3YpaarZaOstqfA0maZmpubYsGwecOemp6lkpq%2Fbq3BqKytZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
