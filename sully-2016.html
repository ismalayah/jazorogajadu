He does it again by embodying the kind of man who wades back and forth through ever-rising waters in a sinking plane to make sure no one is left behind before he even considers his own well-being.</p><p>“<span>Sully” also provides an opportunity for its 86-year-old director <a href=#>Clint Eastwood</a> to stage a variation of the Western-style shootouts he knows so well. But instead of rival cowboys with six-guns a-blasting, this story pits a true hero against the scowling National Transportation Safety Board bureaucrats with their flight simulators, computer analysis and insurance worries who dare to question Sullenberger’s ability to make lightning-quick decisions in the air. They would have rather he made it to a nearby airport after a flock of Canadian geese smashed into the plane and shut down the engines—a possibility he instantly assessed was not feasible given his 40 years of experience.</span></p><p>One also senses that, like his main character, Eastwood believes that possessing years of invaluable on-the-job experience should count for something. You can feel his need to show those whippersnappers with their comic-book franchises how special effects can also be used in the service of re-creating a historic event, not just to erect pricey CGI playgrounds for imaginary rescuers of the world.</p><p>Eastwood revealed his talent for providing a “wow” factor previously in 2010’s drama “<a href=#>Hereafter</a>,” which opened with a terrifyingly realistic whale of a tsunami before drowning in a sea of afterlife hokum. And, as before, the spectacle duly astounds but with a worthier story to tell.</p><p>But is “<span>Sully” great drama? Not exactly, considering that second-guessing provides the main source of tension—by both&nbsp;Sully, who is haunted by nightmarish 9/11-like visions of the plane crashing into Manhattan skyscrapers, and those who are tasked to raise doubts about his actions. But it will keep you fully engrossed, not easy when the central event in question lasted all of 208 seconds and everyone already knows the ending to this near-tragedy is a happy one.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Eastwood hasn’t lost his casting touch as exemplified by the choice of <a href=#>Aaron Eckhart</a>, an actor I have always had a hard time warming to. He adds invaluable wise-guy banter as co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles.&nbsp;<span>Sully&nbsp;is never going to be the life of any party, but his partnership with Skiles, in and out of the&nbsp;cockpit, humanizes him. Being that they are Charlotte-bound, Skiles tells&nbsp;Sully&nbsp;he is going to take him to Del Frisco’s, a famous local steakhouse. “The ribeye will break your heart,” he promises. When the senior aviator says he prefers porterhouse, Skiles quips, “The porterhouse will stop your heart.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46srKWkqWJ%2FcX2V</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
