That means no more Red vs. Blue, unfortunately. The show has been one of the most beloved creations to come out of Rooster Teeth, and it’s the second-longest running web series after Homestar Runner.

The prologue is available to watch online and has been since last year, but fans have been left completely in the dark regarding the release of new episodes.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Typically viewers would be able to access episodes early on Rooster Teeth FIRST, a premium membership service for content from the company. With the announcement earlier this week, it’s uncertain where the final season will be released now.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Still, fans are looking forward to seeing season 19 when it finally drops, especially considering the fact that Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum are returning to write and direct.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnRnptmrqNir63BxGadoqaRoXq0scCspqdlopq5pq3SnmSdmaSafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
