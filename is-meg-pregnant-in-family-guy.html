Family Guy is starting its 22nd season, making it one of the longest-running animated TV shows ever. It first came out in 1999, which was two years after South Park and ten years after The Simpsons, in case you’re keeping track. 
Even though it got canceled briefly, it’s been on Fox/20th Television Animation for a really long time.
