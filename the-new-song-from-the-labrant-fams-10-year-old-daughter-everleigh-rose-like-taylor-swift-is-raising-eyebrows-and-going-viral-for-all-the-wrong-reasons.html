That‚Äôs totally fine, especially considering it was written by a child. Yet, the internet has decided to be a hater, as usual.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>TikTok users flocked to the comments of The LaBrant Fam‚Äôs profiles, particularly that of Everleigh‚Äôs dad Cole, to mock the song and its lyrics, to the point where even fellow former cringe-y child star JoJo Siwa had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to intervene</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúAs the now 20 year old who once was the 10 year old growing up infront of the internet, I wanna say to anyone thats been saying negative things about this song or Everleigh herself, lose your ego and grow up.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Surely in an effort to be both supportive and try to force a viral moment for his kid ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">emulating the Carpool Karaoke video that became the family‚Äôs greatest hit and also features a Taylor Swift song</a> ‚Äî Cole called the song the best he‚Äôs ever heard on his TikTok page, following it up with a lipsync clip of the duo together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true><a title=@thesupercole href=#>@thesupercole</a><p>song slaps</p><a title="‚ô¨ like taylor swift - liv (taylors version) üíú" href=#>‚ô¨ like taylor swift ‚Äì liv (taylors version) üíú</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Commenters largely disagreed with his statement, calling the song ‚Äúhorrible,‚Äù and pointing out how the bridge being composed entirely of Taylor Swift song titles doesn‚Äôt exactly show writing prowess.
